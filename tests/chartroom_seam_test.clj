;; chartroom_seam_test.clj — the other half of the fold's structural seam.
;;
;; core_code_blind_test.clj guards ONE direction (fram-core must not learn beagle-as-
;; subject). This guards the OTHER: the folded chartroom module (beagle source
;; code-intelligence) may rent ONLY fram's small, stable, PUBLIC fact+Datalog surface
;; — it must not reach into engine internals. Co-locating the repos removes the
;; cross-classpath friction that used to make a deep reach cost something, so a CI
;; check replaces it.
;;
;; The allowlist is deliberately TIGHT — exactly what chartroom rents today
;; ({fram.store, fram.datalog}, the same generic family tern pins). Widening it is a
;; conscious seam decision (edit this list), never a silent drift. If chartroom one day
;; legitimately needs fram.kernel/fold, that shows up here as a failing guard prompting
;; the decision — which is the point.
