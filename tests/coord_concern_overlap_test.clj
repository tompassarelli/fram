;; coord_concern_overlap_test.clj — thread 019f1010-2705: concern footprint as
;; code-graph blast joins. The daemon derives a SCOPE-CORRECT calls_defn edge set
;; over the warm corpus (lifting refers_to to the enclosing defn) and exposes:
;;   :blast {:te "@mod#id"}        -> the node's transitive callers (who breaks)
;;   :concern-overlap {:te "@c"}   -> peer concerns whose blast CLOSURE intersects
;; This proves the design's three load-bearing claims over fram's OWN corpus:
;;   (1) :blast = the warm transitive-caller closure (== resolve/blast-closure)
;;   (2) scope-correct: same-named fns in different modules are DISTINCT nodes
;;   (3) overlap is a closure intersection over footprint claims read LIVE; and it
;;       is RENAME-STABLE because footprint is keyed on @mod#int identity, not spelling.
