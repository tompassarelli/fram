;; Shared test-harness readiness contract for spawning a scratch child
;; process (e.g. a split-log JVM coordinator) and waiting for it to become
;; live and speaking the wire protocol — replacing a fixed sleep budget with
;; an observable, bounded loop. Test-only: no production behavior changes.
;;
;; Contract:
;;   - child liveness:     fail immediately once the spawned process has
;;                         exited, instead of continuing to poll a corpse
;;                         until an arbitrary timeout elapses.
;;   - protocol readiness: poll `(ready? port)` until it reports true.
;;   - bounded deadline:   never wait past `:deadline-ms`, even while the
;;                         child is alive — a genuinely hung boot must
;;                         still fail loudly, not spin forever.
;;   - diagnostics:        both failure modes throw ex-info carrying either
;;                         the child's captured exit/stdout/stderr (dead
;;                         child) or the elapsed wait and port (deadline),
;;                         so a flake is debuggable from the test's own
;;                         failure output rather than a bare "timed out".
