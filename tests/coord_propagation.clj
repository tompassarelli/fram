;; cnf_propagation.clj — DEBT 1 PROPAGATION-LATENCY RECEIPT
;;   bb -cp out cnf_propagation.clj
;;
;; Question: after client A commits, how soon can client B observe the change
;; through the daemon read paths? Split RAW (:query, warm cache) vs DERIVED
;; (:callers/refers_to, the resolve walk).
;;
;; Method: copy the REAL code corpus (.fram/code.log) to /tmp, boot an ISOLATED
;; in-process daemon on the COPY (boot-flat!, exactly what serve-flat-daemon does
;; minus serve), and drive handle{} directly. In-process omits only local socket
;; RTT (negligible); the propagation cost lives in the handler logic.
;;
;; SAFETY: operates ONLY on a /tmp COPY of the corpus. Never binds a port, never
;; port 7977, never the canonical tern log, never mutates the original
;; .fram/code.log. The daemon's tail command-dispatch no-ops (no command-line arg).
