;; set_tx_test.clj — regression for finding #17 (lost update on equal-tx).
;;
;; The cold `set` write path (fram.main/cmd-set) used to assign the new line's
;; tx from the fold it took at function ENTRY: tx = (:version f) + 1. Two cold
;; sets that both read the same base version (concurrent processes) therefore
;; both wrote tx = V+1 for the same single-valued (l,p). fold/keyed-latest
;; tie-breaks equal tx with a strict `>` (keep prev only if prev.tx is STRICTLY
;; greater), so on a tie the last-appended line silently wins and the other is
;; dropped — a lost update that max-tx can't even flag (both tx equal, version
;; high-water mark looks fine).
;;
;; The fix: cmd-set assigns tx = (fold/max-tx (read-log)) + 1 from a FRESH
;; re-read taken right BEFORE append (not the entry fold), so a `set` whose
;; append lands after a concurrent writer's line observes it and STRICTLY bumps
;; past it. Two cold sets can no longer collide on tx.
;;
;;   bb -cp out set_tx_test.clj            (uses fresh temp logs; no env needed)

;; ===========================================================================

;; cmd-set's entry-fold and its append. Drives the REAL fram.main/cmd-set.
;; ===========================================================================
;; The race is: writer B folds the base (version 1), and before B appends,
;; writer A's line (tx 2) lands in the log. We reproduce A's mid-flight append
;; deterministically by redefining fram.rt/read-log to return the SHORT (pre-A)
;; log on B's FIRST read (the entry/validation fold) and the GROWN (post-A) log
;; on B's SECOND read.
;;   - OLD cmd-set reads the log ONCE and assigns tx = (:version f)+1 = 1+1 = 2,
;;     COLLIDING with A's already-landed tx 2 (silent lost update).
;;   - NEW cmd-set takes a SECOND fresh read before append; it sees A's line and
;;     assigns tx = max-tx+1 = 3, distinct from A. <-- this is what we assert.
;; A real log file backs the append (cmd-set's append goes through to disk).
