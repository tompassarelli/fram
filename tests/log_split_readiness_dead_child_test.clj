;; Seeded regression: if the coordinator process exits before ever becoming
;; ready, the harness must fail fast (well inside its deadline) and
;; diagnostically (carrying the child's exit code and captured stderr)
;; instead of silently waiting out the full timeout as if it were a slow
;; boot. This is the "dead child" half of the log-split E2E cold-boot-flake
;; fix; see tests/log_split_readiness_slow_boot_test.clj for the "slow boot"
;; half.
