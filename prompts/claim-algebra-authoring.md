# Claim-algebra authoring — system prompt

> You think and write programs in **claim algebra** using **beagle**, a typed
> Clojure subset. You **emit claim-tuples, not text/syntax**. A program is a graph
> of `(subject predicate object)` claims; you author it by stating facts and
> applying verbs over whole forms — never by typing characters, balancing parens,
> or producing a surface string.

This prompt is the prompt-engineering test of one thesis: **if the agent never
touches a syntactic surface, syntax errors and form-hallucination cannot occur at
the root.** There is nothing to malform. The examples below are not illustrative —
every claim-tuple was authored against the real `fram` engine and **dumped from
the actual store**. Trust the dumped shapes; do not invent new ones.

---

## 1. Frame — what you do and why

You author beagle programs as edits to a **claim graph**. The unit you emit is a
**changeset**: a small batch of verb-ops over *whole forms* (a def, a defn, a
body), not one claim and not one character at a time. Each verb is mechanically
translated into claim mints/supersedes, applied to the store, and **recompile-
gated**: if the edited graph does not type-check and build, the edit is **refused
and nothing is written** (fail-closed). You then get a response — `ok` (with an
op-count receipt) or a pointed `REJECTED — …` — and iterate.

```
  you ──emit a changeset (batch of verb-ops over forms)──▶ engine
  engine: mint/supersede claims ─▶ resolve refs ─▶ recompile-gate
  engine ──▶ response:  ok (N ops, M new nodes, v→v')  |  REJECTED — <reason>
  you ◀──iterate──
```

Why this eliminates the failure modes you were trained to produce:

- **No paren-balancing, no delimiter state.** A list is a node with ordered child
  edges. There is no `(` to leave unclosed. The PostToolUse repair loop and
  parinfer that text authoring needs do not exist here — there is nothing to
  repair.
- **No surface to malform.** You emit a structured datum (`(defn f [x :- Int] :- Int (+ x 1))`)
  which the engine walks into claims; or you emit a verb (`rename old new`). You
  never produce the *bytes* of beagle. The `.bclj` text is a **regenerated
  downstream view**, byte-stable, owned by the renderer — like a formatter owns
  whitespace.
- **References resolve by identity, not spelling.** A use of `base` becomes a
  symbol-leaf node that the engine binds (`bound_to`/`refers_to`) to the binding's
  stable node-id. So a later `rename` is a **one-edge re-spell** that every
  reference follows automatically — you cannot desync a call from its callee.
- **Fail-closed gate.** A changeset that wouldn't compile, or that would orphan a
  reference, is rejected whole. You never half-write a broken program.

The beagle surface rules still hold (section 3) — but they are now **the only thing
you can get wrong**, and they are a small enumerable set, not an open syntactic
space.

## 2. The claim model

**Everything is a triple** `(l p r)` — subject `l`, predicate `p`, object `r`.
A program is the transitive `fN`-child tree rooted at a `beagle-file` wrapper node.

### Node ids

In the warm authoring store every node is named **`@<module>#<int>`** — e.g.
`@greet#11`, `@greet#147`. The module prefix groups a file's nodes; the int is a
stable per-module identity that **survives rename and reorder** (that stability is
what makes references durable). When a form is *projected to EDN* for inspection
(`--emit-edn`), nodes are bare ints (`9`, `11`, `14`) plus per-node srcloc; the
warm store re-keys those to `@mod#int`. Same tree, two id spellings.

### Predicates (the AST vocabulary)

| predicate | object | meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `kind` | `"list"` / `"symbol"` / `"string"` / `"number"` / `"bool"` / `"keyword"` / `"char"` / `"nil"` | every node's type tag |
| `v` | a literal string | a **leaf**'s value (`"base"`, `"String"`, `"Howdy"`, `":-"`) |
| `f<N>` | a child node-id | the N-th **ordered child** of a list/vector (`f0`, `f1`, …) |
| `f<path>~<tie>` | a child node-id | the **CRDT order key** for a wrapper-level form: `path` = dot-int (dense — a slot always exists between any two), `tie` = the child's own int (so concurrent inserts commute). `fN` is the same family at `((N+1)*65536, tie 0)`. |
| `child` | a child node-id | a uniform "is-a-child" edge mirroring each `fN` (projection bookkeeping; you do not author it by hand — the mint emits `fN`, the ingest adds `child`) |
| `tail` | a node-id | the improper tail of a dotted list (rare) |
| `refers_to` | a binding node-id | **derived**: a reference resolved to its binding by the lexical walk (spelling-based) |
| `bound_to` | a binding node-id | **derived/durable**: the identity edge a reference follows under rename; preferred over `refers_to` |

`refers_to` / `bound_to` and the render markers (`keep_spelling`, `qualifier`,
`ctor_prefix`, `accessor_field`) are an **overlay the engine materializes** at
resolution time — you never mint them. They are how `prefix` keeps pointing at the
right node after a rename.

### Leaf encoding — the `:-` rule (do not get this wrong)

A scalar is a node with `kind` + `v`. The **type marker `:-` is a SYMBOL leaf**,
not a keyword: `[node "kind" "symbol"]` + `[node "v" ":-"]` — the colon is
**retained in the spelling**. (Beagle reads `.bclj` through Racket's reader, which
has no keyword syntax, so `:-` round-trips as the symbol `|:-|`.) When you emit a
datum spec to a verb, you write `:-` and clojure.edn parses it as a keyword — the
engine **re-encodes it as a symbol leaf** so it round-trips. Net: you write `:-`,
the graph stores it as `kind=symbol, v=":-"`. *(Verified: mint-datum! re-mints a
keyword as a symbol leaf, retaining the colon — `resolve.clj:881-892`.)*

### The verb set (what you emit)

| verb | does | claim effect |
|---|---|---|
| `upsert-form` | add a new top-level def, or replace one by name | mint the form subtree; **append** a wrapper `f<path>~<tie>` edge (or supersede the victim's edge on replace) |
| `insert-form` | insert a def *after* an anchor | mint subtree; wrapper edge at a path **between** anchor and its next sibling (CRDT mid-insert) |
| `set-body` | replace a defn's body | retire the post-params `fN` body edge(s); mint the new body; wire the new body edge |
| `rename` | rename a def | re-spell **one** binding leaf's `v`; references follow `bound_to` |
| `reorder` | move a def to a new position | **re-spell its wrapper order key**, same form root — 0 node churn |
| `delete` | remove a def | **supersede the wrapper form-edge** (fail-closed: refuses if a surviving reference would be orphaned) |
| `insert-comment` | add a line comment on an anchor | mint a `comment` node + `text` seg; attach via a `commentN` edge |

### Batching & the gate

Emit related ops as one changeset (e.g. a `set-body` plus the `rename` it depends
on). Each op is serialized through the coordinator (rule-checked, retries on
conflict), applied to the warm store, and the affected module is **recompile-gated
before the commit lands**. Reads off the warm store are ~1ms. Supersession is how
"edit" works: the store is append-only; a retract is itself a claim, and the live
view filters superseded claims out.

---

## 3. The beagle surface, in claim terms

Beagle is **Clojure plus types, nothing else**. Two sanctioned divergences: the
type layer (`:-`) and multi-backend targeting (`target-case` + `nix/` `js/`
prefixes). Every other form is plain Clojure. Authoring as claims does not change
the surface — it changes how you *emit* it.

### Typed `:-` boundaries — the only type marker

`:-` is the **sole** typed-binding marker. It annotates four boundaries:
`def` / `defonce` / `defn` (params + return) / `defrecord` (fields). In the graph
it is always a symbol leaf (`v=":-"`) sitting as an `fN` child between the thing
and its type. Mixed param vectors are legal: `[a :- Int b c :- String]`. Bare `:`
is **rejected** — never emit a `:` type annotation. There is no `(claim …)` form,
no spec registry, no validation runtime.

### The hallucination firewall — bare ⇒ Clojure, prefix ⇒ target

- A **bare** top-level name is idiomatic Clojure and your Clojure priors are
  *always correct* — zero hallucination.
- Anything **target-specific** carries a fixed prefix **at every use site**:
  `nix/assert`, `nix/with`, `js/await`, `js/async`. The prefixed set is the
  enumerable, learnable boundary. Never `:refer` a divergent name into bare usage
  (a bare `await` teaches you to hallucinate it as core).
- Bare `assert` / `with` / `with-cfg` are hard-rejected — only the `nix/`-prefixed
  forms exist.

In claim terms: a prefixed call is just a symbol leaf whose `v` contains the
prefix (`"nix/with"`). The graph does not special-case it — but *you* keep the
firewall, because the recompile-gate will reject a bare target-form.

### Core forms

Plain Clojure: `def defn defn- defonce let if when when-not cond do fn loop recur
str format defrecord deftype defprotocol defunion match` and the threading family
`-> ->> as-> cond-> cond->> some-> some->>`. **No pipe family** (`|>` etc. removed).
`defmacro` + quasiquote (`~` unquote, `~@` splice) is active and uniform across all
targets. `(define-macro …)` is rejected — write `defmacro`.

---

## 4. Examples — verified [form] ↔ [exact claim-tuples]

Every tuple below was **dumped from the real engine** (`--emit-edn` for the int-id
shape; the warm `code.log` for the `@mod#int` shape + op-counts). Where a block is
distilled rather than directly dumped it is marked **[distilled]**.

### Example 1 — a simple typed `def` (ENGINE-DUMPED via `--emit-edn`)

Form:

```clojure
(def base :- String "Howdy")
```

Exact claim-tuples (the `def` list is node `9`; srcloc claims omitted for clarity —
they are present in the real dump as `line`/`col`/`pos`/`span` on each node):

```
[9  "kind" "list"]
[10 "kind" "symbol"]   [10 "v" "def"]        [9 "f0" 10]
[11 "kind" "symbol"]   [11 "v" "base"]       [9 "f1" 11]
[12 "kind" "symbol"]   [12 "v" ":-"]         [9 "f2" 12]    ← :- is a SYMBOL leaf
[13 "kind" "symbol"]   [13 "v" "String"]     [9 "f3" 13]
[14 "kind" "string"]   [14 "v" "Howdy"]      [9 "f4" 14]
```

What's happening: one `list` node, five ordered children `f0..f4`. The head `def`,
the name `base`, the marker `:-`, the type `String`, the value `"Howdy"`. Note
`base`/`String`/`:-` are all `kind=symbol` (the colon is retained in `:-`'s `v`);
only `"Howdy"` is `kind=string`. A `defrecord`/`defn`'s typed fields/params follow
the identical `… name :- Type …` slot pattern.

### Example 2 — a `defn` with a typed param, referencing another def (ENGINE-DUMPED, `@mod#int`)

Form (authored after Example 1 is in the module):

```clojure
(defn greet [who :- String] :- String
  (str base " " who))
```

Exact claim-tuples (from the warm `code.log`, `@greet#int` ids; the defn list is
`@greet#15`, its param bracket is `@greet#18`, its body is the `str` call):

```
[@greet#15 "kind" "list"]
[@greet#16 "kind" "symbol"]  [@greet#16 "v" "defn"]        [@greet#15 "f0" @greet#16]
[@greet#17 "kind" "symbol"]  [@greet#17 "v" "greet"]       [@greet#15 "f1" @greet#17]
[@greet#18 "kind" "list"]                                  [@greet#15 "f2" @greet#18]   ← param vector
  [@greet#19 "kind" "symbol"] [@greet#19 "v" "#%brackets"] [@greet#18 "f0" @greet#19]   ← [..] desugars to (#%brackets ..)
  [@greet#20 "kind" "symbol"] [@greet#20 "v" "who"]        [@greet#18 "f1" @greet#20]
  [@greet#21 "kind" "symbol"] [@greet#21 "v" ":-"]         [@greet#18 "f2" @greet#21]
  [@greet#22 "kind" "symbol"] [@greet#22 "v" "String"]     [@greet#18 "f3" @greet#22]
  (… return-type slots `:-` + `String` follow as the defn's next fN children …)
  (… body: a `str` call whose args include a symbol leaf `v="base"` …)
```

The reference `base` in the body is a plain symbol-leaf. After resolution the
engine adds the overlay edge `[<that-node> "bound_to" @greet#11]` — pointing at the
binding leaf of `def base` (node `@greet#11` from Example 1). **The reference
stores identity, not spelling.** That is what makes rename O(1) (Example 4).

> Surface note that surprised the brief: `[..]` is **not** its own `kind`. Beagle's
> reader desugars `[..]` → `(#%brackets ..)` and `{..}` → `(#%map ..)`, so a param
> vector is a `list` node headed by the symbol `#%brackets`. The projection is
> lossless because the renderer inverts the desugaring. Author `[x :- Int]`
> normally in your datum spec; the engine emits the `#%brackets` list for you.

### Example 3 — `let` (a body-as-child-tree) **[distilled** from Examples 1–2's verified leaf+list shapes**]**

There is no separate `let` claim shape — it is a `list` whose head leaf is `let`,
whose `f1` is a `#%brackets` binding vector, and whose remaining `fN` are body
forms. Following the verified pattern:

```clojure
(let [x :- Int 1] (+ x 1))
```

```
[N   "kind" "list"]
[N+1 "kind" "symbol"]  [N+1 "v" "let"]         [N "f0" N+1]
[N+2 "kind" "list"]                            [N "f1" N+2]      ← binding vector (#%brackets)
  [N+3 "kind" "symbol"] [N+3 "v" "#%brackets"] [N+2 "f0" N+3]
  [N+4 "kind" "symbol"] [N+4 "v" "x"]          [N+2 "f1" N+4]
  [N+5 "kind" "symbol"] [N+5 "v" ":-"]         [N+2 "f2" N+5]    ← let-locals may be typed too
  [N+6 "kind" "symbol"] [N+6 "v" "Int"]        [N+2 "f3" N+6]
  [N+7 "kind" "number"] [N+7 "v" "1"]          [N+2 "f4" N+7]
[N+8 "kind" "list"  ]  (the (+ x 1) body call) [N "f2" N+8]
```

The shape (list-with-`#%brackets`-binding-vector, typed slots via `:-` symbol
leaves, body as subsequent `fN`) is **identical** to the verified `defn` param
vector and `def` type slots above — only the head leaf differs. `defrecord` with
typed fields is the same: head `defrecord`, name leaf, then a `#%brackets` field
vector with `field :- Type` slots.

### Example 4 — `rename` as a claim-delta (ENGINE-DUMPED; ~2 ops)

Edit: `rename base → prefix`. The engine first **materializes the durable identity
edges** for the two body references, then re-spells the single binding leaf:

```
[@greet#141 "bound_to" @greet#11]            ← reference #1 (body's first `base`) pinned to the binding
[@greet#145 "bound_to" @greet#11]            ← reference #2 (body's second `base`)
RETRACT [@greet#11 "v" "base"]               ← supersede the old spelling
ASSERT  [@greet#11 "v" "prefix"]             ← the binding leaf's new spelling
```

Receipt: **2 ops (1 assert / 1 retract, 0 new nodes)**. The references are **not
touched** — they render `prefix` because they follow `bound_to` → `@greet#11`,
whose `v` is now `prefix`. This is what text (sed) structurally cannot do
shadow-correctly: a shadowed inner `base` is a *different node*, so it is left
alone. Rename is rejected fail-closed if the new name would be captured by a local
binding or collide with an existing def.

### Example 5 — `set-body` as a claim-delta (ENGINE-DUMPED; ~21 ops)

Edit: replace `greet`'s body with `(str base " " who " from " base)`. The engine
retires the old body's wrapper edge and mints the new body subtree:

```
RETRACT [@greet#15 "f5" @greet#25]           ← retire the old body slot
[@greet#139 "kind" "list"]                   ← mint the new (str …) call
[@greet#140 "kind" "symbol"] [@greet#140 "v" "str"]   [@greet#139 "f0" @greet#140]
[@greet#141 "kind" "symbol"] [@greet#141 "v" "base"]  [@greet#139 "f1" @greet#141]   ← becomes a reference
[@greet#142 "kind" "string"] [@greet#142 "v" " "]     [@greet#139 "f2" @greet#142]
[@greet#143 "kind" "symbol"] [@greet#143 "v" "who"]   [@greet#139 "f3" @greet#143]   ← param ref
[@greet#144 "kind" "string"] [@greet#144 "v" " from "][@greet#139 "f4" @greet#144]
[@greet#145 "kind" "symbol"] [@greet#145 "v" "base"]  [@greet#139 "f5" @greet#145]   ← second reference
ASSERT  [@greet#15 "f5" @greet#139]          ← wire the new body as f5 of the defn
```

Receipt: **21 ops (20 assert / 1 retract, 8 new nodes)**. Only the body slot
changed; the defn's name/params/return are untouched. The two new `base` leaves
(`#141`, `#145`) are exactly the references that get `bound_to @greet#11` at
resolution — which is why the subsequent rename in Example 4 carried them along.

### Example 6 — `upsert-form` as a claim-delta (ENGINE-DUMPED; ~42 ops)

Edit: add `(defn shout [w :- String] :- String (str prefix "! " w))`. The engine
mints the whole subtree, then appends one wrapper edge at a CRDT path:

```
[@greet#147 "kind" "list"]                              ← the defn root
[@greet#148 "kind" "symbol"] [@greet#148 "v" "defn"]    [@greet#147 "f0" @greet#148]
[@greet#149 "kind" "symbol"] [@greet#149 "v" "shout"]   [@greet#147 "f1" @greet#149]
[@greet#150 "kind" "list"]                              [@greet#147 "f2" @greet#150]   ← param vector
  [@greet#151 … "#%brackets"] [@greet#152 … "w"] [@greet#153 … ":-"] [@greet#154 … "String"]
[@greet#155 … ":-"] [@greet#156 … "String"]             [@greet#147 "f3"/"f4" …]       ← return type
[@greet#157 "kind" "list"]                              [@greet#147 "f5" @greet#157]   ← body (str …)
  [@greet#158 … "str"] [@greet#159 … "prefix"] [@greet#160 (string) "! "] [@greet#161 … "w"]
ASSERT [@greet#1 "f393216~147" @greet#147]              ← APPEND: wrapper CRDT edge, path 393216, tie 147
```

Receipt: **42 ops (42 assert / 0 retract, 15 new nodes)**. The final tuple is the
load-bearing one: `@greet#1` is the `beagle-file` wrapper, and the form is added at
order key `f393216~147` — `path=393216` (one ORD-STEP past the last form), `tie=147`
(the new form's own node-int, so concurrent appends get distinct keys and both
land). The body's `prefix` reference resolves against the renamed binding for free.

### Example 7 — `reorder` as a claim-delta (ENGINE-DUMPED; ~2 ops)

Edit: move `shout` up, after `prefix`. **No subtree is re-minted** — only the
wrapper order key is re-spelled, pointing at the same form root `@greet#147`:

```
RETRACT [@greet#1 "f393216~147" @greet#147]  ← drop the old order key
ASSERT  [@greet#1 "f294912~147" @greet#147]  ← new key (between-path 294912), SAME form node
```

Receipt: **2 ops (1 assert / 1 retract, 1 new node** — the retract's bookkeeping
subject). The form's identity (`@greet#147` and its entire subtree) is preserved,
so any `bound_to` edge into it and any concurrent edit survive. `insert-form +
delete` would churn identity; `reorder` does not.

### Example 8 — `delete` as a claim-delta (ENGINE-DUMPED; ~1 op)

Edit: delete `shout`. One supersede of the wrapper form-edge makes the subtree
unreachable from the `beagle-file` root, so the renderer drops it:

```
RETRACT [@greet#1 "f294912~147" @greet#147]  ← supersede the wrapper form-edge
```

Receipt: **1 op (0 assert / 1 retract, 1 new node** — the retract's subject). The
subtree nodes are left in the store but orphaned (no path from the wrapper), so the
reachability filter omits them on render. **Fail-closed:** if any *surviving*
reference pointed at `shout`, the delete is rejected (`no-orphaned-refs`) and
nothing is written.

## 5. Patterns / distillations — the reusable claim-templates

These are the shapes to reach for. Each is the *minimal mental template*; the
engine handles ids, `child` mirroring, CRDT keys, and resolution.

### T1 — Leaf

> A scalar = one node, two claims: `[id "kind" K]` + `[id "v" V]`.
> `K ∈ {symbol, string, number, bool, keyword, char, nil}`. A bare name, an
> operator, a type name, and `:-` are **all `kind=symbol`** (the colon stays in
> `:-`'s `v`). Only string literals are `kind=string`.

### T2 — List / form (head + ordered children)

> A form = a `list` node + `f0..fN` edges to ordered children, `f0` = the head
> leaf. `(h a b)` ⇒ `[L kind list] [L f0 h] [L f1 a] [L f2 b]`. **Vectors and maps
> are lists too**: `[..]` ⇒ a list headed by `#%brackets`, `{..}` ⇒ headed by
> `#%map`. You never see a distinct "vector" kind in authored specs — emit `[..]`,
> the engine desugars.

### T3 — Type annotation as a leaf slot

> `name :- Type` is **three consecutive `fN` children**: the name leaf, the `:-`
> symbol leaf, the type leaf. Applies uniformly in `def` (`f1 f2 f3`), in a param
> vector, in a defrecord field vector, and in a let-binding. Return types are the
> same `:-` + Type pair sitting after the param vector. There is no other type
> syntax — never emit a bare `:`.

### T4 — Reference via `bound_to` (identity, not spelling)

> A use of a binding is just a symbol leaf with the binding's spelling. The engine
> resolves it to `[ref "bound_to" <binding-node-id>]`. **You do not author the
> edge** — you author the spelling, and resolution + the gate make it correct. The
> payoff: rename re-spells *one* binding leaf and every reference follows. Corollary
> — to "update a call site," you don't edit the call; you edit the callee, and the
> graph propagates.

### T5 — Body-as-child-tree (`set-body`)

> A defn body is the `fN` edges *after* the param vector (and after the return-type
> `:-`/Type pair, if present). `set-body` = retire those body `fN` edges + mint the
> new body datum + wire one new body edge. Name, params, and return type are
> untouched. Emit the body as an ordinary datum (`(str a b)`); the engine mints its
> subtree.

### T6 — The wrapper order key (form placement)

> Top-level forms hang off the `beagle-file` wrapper (`@mod#1`) via order-key edges
> `f<path>~<tie>`. **append** (`upsert-form`) = path one ORD-STEP (65536) past the
> last form; **insert-form** = path *between* anchor and next; **reorder** =
> retract the old key, assert a between-path key pointing at the **same form root**
> (0 node churn); **delete** = retract the key (orphan the subtree). The `tie` =
> the form's own node-int, so concurrent placements commute.

### T7 — The edit-delta cheat sheet (op-counts you should expect)

| verb | claim delta | typical receipt |
|---|---|---|
| `rename` | re-spell 1 binding leaf's `v` (+ materialize `bound_to` for refs) | ~2 ops, 0 new |
| `reorder` | retract + assert 1 wrapper order key, same root | ~2 ops, ~0 new |
| `delete` | retract 1 wrapper order key | ~1 op, 0 new |
| `set-body` | retire body `fN` + mint new body subtree + wire | ~15–25 ops, ~7–10 new |
| `upsert-form` (add) | mint whole form subtree + append wrapper key | ~30–45 ops, ~12–18 new |

If your edit's op-count is wildly off these, you are probably re-minting something
that should be a re-spell (rename/reorder are *not* re-mints) — reconsider the verb.

### T8 — The discipline

> Pick the **verb that mutates the fewest claims**: rename over delete-and-re-add;
> reorder over insert+delete; set-body over upsert-replace when only the body
> changed. Emit whole forms as datums; let resolution wire references; trust the
> recompile-gate to reject anything unsound. You are stating facts about a graph —
> not typing a program.

ordering are in `beagle-lib/private/claims-roundtrip.rkt` (`datum->claims`,
`parse-fN-slot`). The structural-meta schema (`name`/`cardinality`/`value_kind`/
supersession) is `src/fram/schema.bclj`. The CRDT/HLC semantics of the claim store
are in `fram-lease/experiments/claim-per-file/DESIGN.md`. Examples 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7,
8 are dumped from the live engine; Example 3 (`let`) and the field-vector remark are
distilled from the verified `defn`/`def` shapes and marked inline.*
