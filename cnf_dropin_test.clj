;; cnf_dropin_test.clj — Stage 7 drop-in gate: the reified daemon as a reversible
;; DROP-IN over the EXISTING flat log (no format change). Proven on a COPY:
;;   - boots by migrating the flat log -> reified store (live view == flat fold);
;;   - socket writes commit through the reified substrate AND append the flat line;
;;   - EXTERNAL flat edits (capture/import/set, out-of-band) are absorbed on the
;;     next op via reload — so every existing write path keeps working;
;;   - base_version contention holds.
;; Cardinality comes from chelonia.kernel/single? (no hardcoded vocab); touches no
;; live file.
