;; core_code_blind_test.clj — the fold guard (corrected, predicate-precise).
;;
;; INVARIANT: fram-core (src/fram/*.bclj — the GENERIC claims + Datalog engine) must
;; stay BLIND to beagle-as-SUBJECT. This exists so that folding chartroom (beagle
;; source code-intelligence) into this repo cannot let beagle-shaped logic seep into
;; the generic core once the cross-repo friction that used to enforce that seam is gone.
;;
;; TWO axes of "depends on beagle" must NOT be confused:
;;   axis 1 (cosmetic) — fram-core is AUTHORED in beagle. `(defn ..)`, `(ns ..)`,
;;       `(:require ..)` appear as IMPLEMENTATION. Fine. Dissolves on a reimplementation
;;       in another language. This guard must NOT flag it.
;;   axis 2 (real)     — fram-core reasons OVER beagle syntax as DATA: "defn"/"defrecord"/
;;       "beagle-file" as QUOTED string literals it matches/dispatches on. Survives a
;;       reimplementation = genuine subject-matter coupling. THIS is the only leak we ban.
;;
;; Falsifiable test for the ban-set: "would this token survive a reimplementation in Zig?"
;;   `(defn f [..] ..)`            -> dissolves -> axis 1 -> NOT banned.
;;   `(contains? DEF-FORMS "defn")`-> survives  -> axis 2 -> BANNED.
;;
;; The ban-set MIRRORS chartroom's actual beagle-as-subject signature (resolve.clj's
;; PARAM-FORMS/TYPE-DEFS/... string-head sets). It deliberately does NOT include generic
;; graph vocabulary (calls, refers_to — domain-neutral edge labels any claims domain may
;; use) nor beagle import keywords (:require/:as/:refer — those appear in fram's OWN ns
;; forms as axis-1 implementation). It matches QUOTED tokens in CODE (comment lines skipped),
;; anchored to the quotes, never bare substrings (so "recalls"/"syscalls"/prose don't trip).
;;
;; The folded chartroom module lives OUTSIDE src/fram/ (its own build target) and is
;; intentionally exempt — its whole job is beagle-as-subject.
