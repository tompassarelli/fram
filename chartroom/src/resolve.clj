;; Turtle #5 — the identity steal: references store IDENTITY, not spelling.
;; ============================================================================
;; A real LEXICAL resolver adds `refers_to <binding-node-id>` to each reference,
;; pointing it at the *correct* binding under shadowing (nearest enclosing scope),
;; not merely a binding with the right spelling. Binding occurrence = a symbol
;; leaf: a top-level def name, a fn/defn param, or a let/loop binding.
;;
;; With references carrying identity:
;;   - rename is O(1): edit ONE binding's name; references render via refers_to.
;;   - rename is EXACT under shadowing: a shadowed inner `red` is a different node
;;     than the outer def, so renaming one leaves the other alone — which text
;;     (sed) structurally cannot do.
;;   - "orphaned reference after delete" is a query (refers_to → a dead node).

;; Every piece of computed resolution state lives in a dynamic var with an INERT
;; root binding (nil / empty atom). `resolve-edn!` rebinds them all to a FRESH
;; store before loading EDN, so the resolver runs over an ARBITRARY bound store
;; (a daemon's warm in-memory store) — not a load-time global. The CLI path is
;; byte-identical: it just calls `resolve-edn!` inside the same binding scope and
;; reads the bound vars exactly as before. Predicate/marker VALUE IDS are
;; store-local (cnf interns ids per store), so they MUST be recomputed against
;; the fresh store and are dynamic too — keeping a root-store value id would write
;; a foreign id into store B (the load-bearing seam GATE B guards).

;; it binds *reject!* to throw, converting the exit into a catchable signal. Default
;; = real exit (verbatim CLI behavior). Verb arms call (*reject!* code) — or

;; (replace-in-body's candidates/:within remedy) — instead of (System/exit code), so

;; point: it does NOT prove uniqueness, it SELECTS the default-main member of a possibly-multi
;; group. Routing the former bare `(first …)` take-firsts through it makes the selection named
;; rather than silently buried; when first-class views land (VIEWS_AND_BRANCHES §8) this is
;; where a `view` argument attaches (thread E: it now does, via `*view*`).
;; *view* — the read-side attach point first-class views land on (VIEWS_AND_BRANCHES §8;
;; thread E). nil = the privileged default-main view (today's only view): elect the whole
;; group, byte-identical to before. Bound to a view-subject NAME = a named branch overlay:

;; replace-in-body — SUB-DEF surgical edit. Replace ONE interior form inside a def,
;; addressed by an ANCHOR datum (the OLD form, as it reads in source), with a NEW
;; form — WITHOUT re-emitting the whole def. Kills the mega-def floor (duel lever #2):
;; changing one case in a 1,768-line def costs ONE fN-edge swap, not a whole-def
;; re-mint. Same claim-op discipline as set-body — supersede exactly the touched fN
;; edge, mint the replacement, recompile-gated + fail-closed — but at INTERIOR
;; granularity. Because only one edge moves and the def is never re-minted, EVERY
;; sibling form + all attached comments (the def's leading comments, other cases)
;; survive untouched — it does not carry set-body's comment-fidelity loss (019f208b-d67b).
;;
;; ADDRESSING — anchor-form match (Edit-tool old_string, but on the AST). The model
;; emits the OLD interior form + the NEW one; we canonicalize both STRUCTURALLY (kind
;; + rendered spelling + child shape, whitespace/formatting ignored) and require the
;; anchor to match EXACTLY ONE interior node. 0 or >1 matches REFUSE (no claims
;; mutated) — the model disambiguates by supplying a larger enclosing form, exactly
;; like old_string uniqueness. Structural (not textual) match is why the model need
;; not reproduce whitespace: it emits the form, we compare shape.
;;
;; render-sym — the spelling a symbol node RENDERS as (mirrors extract-file!'s
;; reference-rendering): a resolved reference shows its binding's CURRENT name
;; (mode-adjusted: ctor prefix, x/qualifier, :rename keep-spelling); an unresolved /
;; literal symbol shows its stored v. Matching the anchor against the RENDERED
;; spelling (not the stored v) is what makes the model's old-form — read off the
;; current source text — line up with the graph even after a prior graph rename.
