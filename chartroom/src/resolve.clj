;; Turtle #5 — the identity steal: references store IDENTITY, not spelling.
;; ============================================================================
;; A real LEXICAL resolver adds `refers_to <binding-node-id>` to each reference,
;; pointing it at the *correct* binding under shadowing (nearest enclosing scope),
;; not merely a binding with the right spelling. Binding occurrence = a symbol
;; leaf: a top-level def name, a fn/defn param, or a let/loop binding.
;;
;; With references carrying identity:
;;   - rename is O(1): edit ONE binding's name; references render via refers_to.
;;   - rename is EXACT under shadowing: a shadowed inner `red` is a different node
;;     than the outer def, so renaming one leaves the other alone — which text
;;     (sed) structurally cannot do.
;;   - "orphaned reference after delete" is a query (refers_to → a dead node).

;; --- bound resolution state (DYNAMIC, inert root) ---------------------------
;; Every piece of computed resolution state lives in a dynamic var with an INERT
;; root binding (nil / empty atom). `resolve-edn!` rebinds them all to a FRESH
;; store before loading EDN, so the resolver runs over an ARBITRARY bound store
;; (a daemon's warm in-memory store) — not a load-time global. The CLI path is
;; byte-identical: it just calls `resolve-edn!` inside the same binding scope and
;; reads the bound vars exactly as before. Predicate/marker VALUE IDS are
;; store-local (cnf interns ids per store), so they MUST be recomputed against
;; the fresh store and are dynamic too — keeping a root-store value id would write
;; a foreign id into store B (the load-bearing seam GATE B guards).
