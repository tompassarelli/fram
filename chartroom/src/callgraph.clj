;; ============================================================================
;; callgraph — the SCOPE-CORRECT call-graph engine (Layer 2, on Fram).
;; ============================================================================
;; Derives the scope-correct call graph of a beagle source tree from its CNF
;; claim projection, with the transitive blast radius computed by Fram Datalog.
;; A call binds the defn in its OWN module (module-local lexical scope; else a
;; unique global; else ambiguous/external -> dropped), so same-named functions
;; across modules never collide — the failure mode of bare-symbol text matching.
;;
;; This is the CNF-projection call-graph core, used by chartroom.clj's gjoa BENCHMARK.
;; LIMITATION: the CNF projection (beagle-claims) does not emit require/:as info, so a
;; QUALIFIED cross-module call (a/f, fully-qualified m/f) cannot be resolved here and is
;; dropped (under-counting cross-module blast). The PRODUCTION call graph (beagle-callgraph
;; / cascade) does NOT use this — it derives the graph from resolve.clj's converged
;; `refers_to` (the `callgraph` mode), which resolves qualified cross-module calls correctly.
;; This module remains for the gjoa CNF benchmark (mostly unqualified) where its scope-
;; correct-vs-bare-symbol point still holds; reprojecting gjoa to the AST is a follow-up.
;; Requirable as a library; runnable as a CLI:
;;
;;   bb -cp <fram/out>:<chartroom/src> -m callgraph <claims-file>   ; -> JSON on stdout
