;; Chartroom — code-as-claims on Fram.
;; ============================================================================
;; Loads a beagle source tree (already projected to CNF claim triples by
;; `beagle-claims`) into a Fram claim store, derives the NAMESPACE-CORRECT
;; function call graph, and runs two benchmarks that validate-or-kill the bet:
;;
;;   A. caller precision on name collisions   (graph resolves scope; bare-symbol can't)
;;   B. transitive leverage / blast radius     (one fixpoint; a one-hop tool can't)
;;
;; Run:  bb -cp ~/code/fram/out src/chartroom.clj build/gjoa.claims
