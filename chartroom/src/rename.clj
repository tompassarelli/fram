;; Turtle #4 — graph-native authoring: a SCOPE-CORRECT rename as a claim edit.
;; ============================================================================
;; Loads two modules' reader-claims into ONE Fram store, then renames a symbol
;; in ONE module by SUPERSEDING its `v` claims (claim-native: nothing is
;; overwritten — the old claims stay, marked not-live, fully recoverable). The
;; other module's identically-named symbol is untouched. Re-projects each file's
;; (mutated) source. A text `sed` rename would corrupt both files; the graph
;; edit is correct by construction because scope is structural, not lexical.
