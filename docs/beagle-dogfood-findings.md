# Beagle dogfooding — findings (gap list)

A real artifact, not scar tissue. The discipline: when typing dynamic data forces a
contortion, write it down here as "Beagle lacks X" — don't silently absorb it as
`Any` in the code. (Policy lives in the global beagle-authoring skill, §4.)

The probe that matters is **not** "does interop compile?" (it does, trivially) — it's
**"can I replace this `Any` with a real type, or does Beagle force me back to `Any`?"**

## How this list was built

Two passes:
1. **Small probes** (reachability dedup, the gateway gatepolicy module). Found **no** gaps —
   fn-types, records, typed maps, `Float` all expressed cleanly; the `Any` was author laziness.
2. **The engine-typing pass** — typed the *whole* Fram core (cnf/schema/datalog/query/tools/main,
   ~141 `:- Any` sites). **106 sites took real types; 35 remain justified boundaries.** Typing at
   that scale is what surfaced the real gaps below — and fixed a latent `schema/value-id` nil bug
   that `Any` had been masking (it's genuinely `Int?`; now guarded before the index lookups).

So: Beagle's coverage is strong for *leaf* types and records, and the bail-to-`Any` reflex is
usually laziness — but typing a real interpreter end-to-end hits genuine, recordable limits.

## Genuine Beagle gaps (prioritized — these feed the language)

| # | Gap | Impact in Fram | Suggested direction |
|---|---|---|---|
| G1 | **No type alias / synonym** (`deftype` removed, no `defalias`) | `Db`/`Subst`/`Tuple`/`Lit`/`Rule` (~50 sites) must be spelled inline — e.g. `(Map String (Set (Vec Any)))` re-typed at every signature. The single biggest source of `Any`-drift pressure. | A `(defalias Db (Map String (Set (Vec Any))))` form. **Highest value.** |
| G2 | **No parametric `(Atom T)`** | `(Atom Store)` is hard-rejected; bare `Atom` typechecks but `deref`/`swap!` erase the element type, so every store read recovers the shape with `(let [s :- Store (deref ctx)] …)`. Affects every `ctx` in cnf/schema/datalog. | Parametric `Atom` in the ctor allow-list. |
| G3 | **No heterogeneous tuple / `HVec`** | only homogeneous `(Vec T)`. A datalog fact `[cid l p r]` (`Int` then `String`s), a dump entry `[Int claim-map]`, an index key `[l p]` all collapse to `(Vec Any)`; reads via `(nth e 1)` degrade to `Any`. | `(HVec Int String String String)` / tuple types. |
| G4 | **No open / optional-key map (no row polymorphism)** | a `defrecord` always has *all* keys, so key-presence discrimination breaks: query's `:strata`-xor-`:rules`, `term-ok?`'s `(contains? t :var)`, the `{:ok …}`/`{:error …}` result envelopes. Forces `Any` at `query/run`, `tools/call` return, `main/route-write`. | Open/optional-key map types, or sum-of-records the checker can discriminate. |
| G5 | **`defenum` is not enforced by the checker** | `(->ToolSpec … :bogus …)` into an `Op`-typed field AND `(= op :nonmember)` against an `Op` both pass with 0 errors. `defenum` documents intent but doesn't yet *constrain*. | Make the checker reject non-member keywords against an enum-typed slot. |
| G6 | **The `Any`-assignability hole** | narrowing `Any → Int` via `(:seq m)` over a `(Map Keyword Any)` (e.g. `tx-seq`/`value-id` returns) passes `beagle check` only because `Any` is assignable to anything — the narrowed return type is documented intent, **not** verified. Largely a *consequence* of G3+G4 (those force `Map Keyword Any`, then field access is `Any`). | Tighter assignability from `Any`, or eliminate the upstream `Any` via G3/G4. |
| G7 | **`doseq`/`for` clause bindings reject `:- T`** | `(doseq [e :- (Vec Any) …])` is unparseable; you bind `e` plainly (infers `Any`) and re-annotate inside the body with a `let`. (`loop` bindings *do* accept `:- T`.) | Allow `:- T` in `for`/`doseq` binding clauses for parity with `loop`. |

### Non-gap (refactor cost, recorded so it isn't mistaken for one)
- **Map literals don't coerce to records:** `{:l 1 :p 2 :r 3}` is rejected where a record is
  expected, so adopting a record means refactoring producers to `(->Ctor …)`. We deliberately did
  **not** recordize `CnfClaim`/`Tx`/`WriteIntent`: a hand-written `.clj` consumer
  (`cnf_coord/assemble-dump`) feeds plain maps into `load-store!`, and two suites assert whole-map
  equality — a record `≠` a map literal in Clojure, so recordizing would break green tests for zero
  runtime gain (every real consumer uses field access). Kept as `(Map Keyword Any)`. This is the
  "willing to NOT migrate when a typed seam doesn't earn it" discipline in action.

## Justified `Any` (the honest boundaries — 35 sites)

`Any` is correct where data is genuinely open or crosses a serialization/untrusted seam:
the value interner (`cnf/value!` — the engine accepts arbitrary EDN), the dump/load
serialization boundary (heterogeneous `[k v]` tuples → G3), the domain-agnostic actor token
(`begin-tx!`'s `agent`), polymorphic datalog terms (`{:var n}`-or-constant → G4), and the
open keyword-map query/result envelopes (→ G4). Each is annotated with *why* at the site.

## The conclusion (updated)

The first small probes found the gap was **discipline** (reflexive `Any`). Typing the whole
engine confirmed that *and* found where Beagle genuinely needs to grow: **G1 (type aliases)**
and **G4 (open-key maps / row polymorphism)** are the two that would convert the most remaining
justified-`Any` into real types, with **G5 (enforce `defenum`)** being a correctness gap in the
checker itself. These belong in Beagle's roadmap — that's the payoff of dogfooding: a typed
interpreter is the forcing function that a leaf-type probe never will be.
