;; cnf_rename_spelling_check.clj — minimal decisive CORE rename check (fast, no Beagle,
;; no re-materialize). The human identifier lives as the `v` SPELLING of symbol leaves.
;; References resolve BY SPELLING on cold re-derive (refers_to is derived, 0-persisted).
;; So: after a CORE do-edit-min rename replace!->supersede-prior!, do reference leaves
;; still spell "replace!"? If yes, a cold render re-derives by spelling, can't match the
;; renamed def, and shows "replace!" => the exact FAIL, and it is a CORE bug.
