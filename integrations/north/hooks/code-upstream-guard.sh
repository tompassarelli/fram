# PreToolUse guard — the DETERMINISTIC half of "the graph is the editing surface".
# ============================================================================
# STATUS: OWNER COPY. Fram owns this integration at
# `fram:integrations/north/hooks/code-upstream-guard.sh`; North composes it into
# `~/.agents/hooks/code-upstream-guard.sh` beside the shared kill-switch library
# and manages the global guard state. To run a clean-room/experiment session
# WITHOUT this guard, use persistent `north config guards off`, or launch with
# AGENT_NO_AUTHORING_HOOKS set to any value but 0/false.
#
# WHAT IT DOES
#   On Edit | Write | MultiEdit it reads tool_input.file_path from the hook's stdin
#   JSON and asks: is THIS file graph-upstream? If and only if it is, it RETURNS a
#   PreToolUse permissionDecision of "deny" with a reason that redirects the agent to
#   the graph-edit MCP tools. For every other file it returns NOTHING (empty stdout),
#   which Claude Code treats as "no opinion" — ordinary edits sail through untouched.
#
#   PreToolUse is the ONLY hook event that can REFUSE a call: permissionDecision:deny
#   short-circuits the tool before it runs. PostToolUse fires AFTER the write — too
#   late to keep text from becoming a second source of truth. So enforcement lives here.
#
# SCOPING — why this never blocks ordinary edits (the critical requirement)
#   The guard is FAIL-OPEN and CLOSED-LIST. A file is graph-upstream iff it is named
#   in the explicit all\-list resolved by is_claim_canonical() below. The list starts
#   as EXACTLY ONE adopted module. A file that is missing, unreadable, not in the
#   list, or that the check errors on -> the script prints nothing and exits 0, i.e.
#   the edit is ALLOWED. The deny path is reached only on a positive, explicit match.
#   There is no glob like "*.bclj" — adoption is per-file and opt-in, mirroring the
#   "capability vs adoption" line in
#   `~/.agents/skills/code-as-facts/SKILL.md`.
#
# THE MARKER
#   Adoption is recorded two redundant ways; a file is canonical if EITHER holds:
#     (1) the file's path appears (one absolute path per line, blank/`#` lines
#         ignored) in the registry file $GRAPH_UPSTREAM_REGISTRY
#         (default: ~/.config/fram/graph-upstream-files). A row is matched by
#         REALPATH identity (so a symlink alias to an adopted file cannot bypass)
#         OR by shared Git provenance from a TRUSTED git — resolved off a managed
#         bin allow-list and admitted only if its canonical identity is an
#         immutable /nix/store binary or a root-owned non-writable system binary,
#         and run with ambient global/system Git config suppressed — using the
#         same `--git-common-dir` + repo-relative path, so a row naming only the
#         primary checkout also
#         covers an edit of the same file reached through a durable linked
#         worktree — no per-worktree paths are enumerated, and a missing/hostile
#         git can never let a direct or aliased edit of an adopted file through, OR
#     (2) the file's LEADING COMMENT BLOCK carries the in-band directive
#         ;; @upstream:graph  (the marker in code-as-facts SKILL.md). It is a Beagle line comment, so it
#         survives the lossless round-trip as a comment node and recompiles
#         cleanly. Only a leading `;;` comment whose payload IS the marker (with
#         optional suffix prose) counts — an explanatory MENTION of the marker,
#         or marker-like text in a string or code body, never self-adopts.
#   (1) is the source of truth for the guard (cheap, no file read needed if absent);
#   (2) lets a file self-declare and travels with the file. Adoption = add the path
#   to the registry (and optionally stamp the sentinel). De-adoption = remove it.
#   Nothing about the guard is implicit.

This file's UPSTREAM is the GRAPH: the code lives in the Fram graph — recursive
Triples whose selected live view IS the program; this
text is GENERATED output. A text Edit/Write would desync the graph and is refused. Author it as a GRAPH
EDIT via the fram MCP tools instead:
  - mcp__fram__add-def     — add a new top-level def (upsert-form, new name)
  - mcp__fram__set-body    — replace a defn's body
  - mcp__fram__rename-def  — rename a def (O(1), scope-correct via refers_to)
Each is recompile-gated and fail-closed; the regenerated text is a downstream view.
See the code-as-facts skill. (To edit as text anyway you must first
de-adopt the file from the graph-upstream registry — a deliberate workflow change.)
