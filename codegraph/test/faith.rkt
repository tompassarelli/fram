;; Falsify "valid beagle" standing in for "faithful". The high bar: the mutated,
;; re-projected, re-read tree must equal the ORIGINAL tree with EXACTLY the
;; symbol substitution applied and nothing else (types, structure, every other
;; form intact). With no substitution args, asserts the file is byte/datum-identical
;; (the untouched-file case).
;;   racket faith.rkt <orig.bjs> <mutated.edn> [<old-sym> <new-sym>]
;; Resolves against a sibling beagle checkout (../../beagle), the layout the rest
;; of the repo assumes (see Prerequisites in README; bin/* default to $HOME/code/beagle).
