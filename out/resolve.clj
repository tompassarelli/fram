;; Turtle #5 — the identity steal: references store IDENTITY, not spelling.
;; ============================================================================
;; A real LEXICAL resolver adds `refers_to <binding-node-id>` to each reference,
;; pointing it at the *correct* binding under shadowing (nearest enclosing scope),
;; not merely a binding with the right spelling. Binding occurrence = a symbol
;; leaf: a top-level def name, a fn/defn param, or a let/loop binding.
;;
;; With references carrying identity:
;;   - rename is O(1): edit ONE binding's name; references render via refers_to.
;;   - rename is EXACT under shadowing: a shadowed inner `red` is a different node
;;     than the outer def, so renaming one leaves the other alone — which text
;;     (sed) structurally cannot do.
;;   - "orphaned reference after delete" is a query (refers_to → a dead node).

;; --- bound resolution state (DYNAMIC, inert root) ---------------------------
;; Every piece of computed resolution state lives in a dynamic var with an INERT
;; root binding (nil / empty atom). `resolve-edn!` rebinds them all to a FRESH
;; store before loading EDN, so the resolver runs over an ARBITRARY bound store
;; (a server's warm in-memory store) — not a load-time global. The CLI path calls
;; `resolve-edn!` inside the same binding scope and therefore observes the same
;; store-local state and semantics. Predicate/marker VALUE IDS are
;; store-local (cnf interns ids per store), so they MUST be recomputed against
;; the fresh store and are dynamic too — keeping a root-store value id would write
;; a foreign id into store B (the load-bearing seam GATE B guards).
;; S2: `ctx` is the TermStore atom exposed to store-level callers; `rctx` is the
;; authoring/read Graph over that same store. `tx` and `SUP` have no successor in
;; the frame store: transactions are frames, and retractions create occurrence-native
;; withdrawal records. They survive ONLY as bound Vars for the external shim surface.

;; A comment is a sequence of text + symbol-candidate segments. A symbol segment
;; that EXACTLY names an in-scope binding (module def / type / refer-import) gets
;; a refers_to edge — so it renders the binding's CURRENT name and renames with
;; it, exactly like code. A `red-zone` token is one symbol (≠ `red`) and a quoted
;; `"red"` was demoted to text by beagle's lexer, so neither resolves: the rename
;; win without the sed corruption. Module scope (comments-in-bodies are a follow-up).
;; M1 Cut G — the comment resolver and the per-src walk driver are Beagle too
;; (src/resolve_walk.bclj). `walk-corpus` packages the four corpus tables the
;; driver reads; `make-xresolve` lives in resolve_corpus and receives the current
;; global export tables as explicit parameters, then is handed over as the
;; per-src resolver factory, which
;; is why the ^:dynamic *xresolve*/*tresolve*/*aresolve* are no longer rebound on
;; this path — the module builds each src's three resolvers itself. re-resolve! still
;; binds them, and reads them through walk-env.
