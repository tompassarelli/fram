;; :blocked/:leverage/:validate/:status/:subscribe), so fram.rt's socket
;; client + the CLI + the MCP work UNCHANGED after the cutover. Internally it
;; commits through the reified kernel (cnf_coord) over the v2 log, and serves
;; reads by projecting the reified live view into the EXISTING, proven projections
;; (fram.projections) — the read side of the cutover. The reified live view
;; is set-equal to the flat fold (cnf_domain_test/cnf_lifecycle_test), so those
;; projections return identical results.
