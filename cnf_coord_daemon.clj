;; ============================================================================
;; The whole-module path (bin/fram-commit-code) renders the edited module, emit-edn's
;; it into a FRESH numbering, and commits the WHOLE-module delta vs the coordinator —
;; ~7800 ops for a 1-line set-body, because emit-edn RENUMBERS every node after the
;; edit point. That false-conflicts two agents editing DIFFERENT defns in the SAME
;; module (each rewrites the module), which kills disjoint-edit commutation — the
;; entire thesis.
;;
;; :edit-min instead commits exactly the verb's OWN mint/supersede ops. The authoring
;; verb (resolve.clj verb-set-body!/verb-rename!/verb-upsert-form!) already writes a
;; SMALL claim delta: it mints a new body subtree (kind/v/fN claims on fresh nodes),
;; points the parent's body fN edge at the new root, and SUPERSEDES the old body fN
;; edges. We:
;;   1. CLONE the warm store ((atom @st) — persistent map, O(1), swap!s don't touch
;;      `co`), record `since` = the clone's :next-id.
;;   2. run the verb over the CLONE via resolve/run-verb-warm! (NO text, NO emit-edn,
;;      NO whole-module render). The verb mints/supersedes against LOG-RESIDENT node
;;      identity, exactly as the text path would.
;;   3. HARVEST the delta from the clone:
;;        - NEW entities (objects >= since, not values/claims): the minted AST nodes.
;;          Each needs STABLE coordinator identity — assign @<mod>#<int> at the next
;;          free int for the module (the same @<mod>#<int> shape migrate-flat->co /
;;          s/name! use), memoized clone-eid -> wire-name.
;;        - NEW AST claims (cid >= since, p in the emit-edn vocabulary): translate
;;          (l p r) to wire NAMES (subject + ref object via the name map; literal
;;          object verbatim) -> :assert ops.
;;        - NEW supersede markers (cid >= since, p == supersedes-pred): each victim
;;          (the marker's :r) is an OLD AST claim; translate its (l p r) to names ->
;;          :retract op. (Derived resolve-pred claims the verb's re-resolve! wrote on
;;          the clone are NOT committed — the log carries 0 derived lines.)
;;   4. apply the harvested asserts + retracts to the REAL `co` THROUGH do-assert/
;;      do-retract — the SAME single-(te,p,r) OCC wire every commit uses. So the edit
;;      gets per-(te,p)-group base-version OCC, flat-log persistence + fsync, dirty-
;;      marking (scoped re-resolve), and notify, all for free. Two disjoint same-module
;;      edits touch DISJOINT (te,p) groups => they NEVER conflict (commute by
;;      construction). Order: retract old fN edges FIRST, then assert leaves (kind/v)
;;      before parent fN re-points (so a referenced child exists before its parent

;; The flat fold (fram.fold) is KEYED-LATEST-BY-:tx: a single-valued predicate keys
;; on (l,p) [an LWW cell]; a multi on (l,p,r) [the edge]; per key the MAX-:tx line
;; wins and a `retract` whose :tx dominates drops the key. So for ANY key first
;; touched in a tail T past a snapshot at seq N, every tail line has :tx > N >= every
;; snapshot-era line for that key — the tail's max-:tx line for the key dominates the
;; whole history. THEREFORE: per-key keyed-latest over T, applied onto the snapshot
;; store (whose keys T is silent on are left untouched), reconstructs EXACTLY a full
;; fold of the whole log. That is the whole correctness argument for incremental boot
;; + tail-fold reload + as-of; it is GATED at runtime by snapshot-reconcile (diff the
;; incremental store's live name-triples against a from-scratch whole-migrate).
;; This is the fix for the mislabeled "single-writer" bottleneck: the writer's one
;; job (id allocation) STAYS single + serialized; what was O(history) — boot re-fold
;; and the whole-log re-migrate on EVERY out-of-band append — becomes O(delta).
