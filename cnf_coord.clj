;; cnf_coord.clj — Stage 6: the coordinator on the REIFIED kernel.
;; ============================================================================
;; Sole writer, serialized (one lock). The flat coord.clj's proven skeleton
;; (locking write-lock, optimistic base_version, rule-check, append+notify),
;; rebuilt over the reified store (fram.cnf + fram.schema). Full Clojure
;; — direct, mutable access to the store map, no Beagle typing friction.
;;
;; The six concurrency/durability holes the analysis flagged, closed here:
;;   1. base_version  = max tx-seq over the LIVE claims on (l,p); a stale
;;      single-valued write is rejected (lost-update protection).
;;   2. validate-without-mutating — obligations (acyclicity) are a PURE pre-check
;;      over resolved ids, run BEFORE any tx/entity is minted, so a rejected
;;      write leaves ZERO unlogged state (else the live store would diverge from
;;      a replay of the log).
;;   3. single-subject obligations (depends_on/part_of acyclicity) for v1.
;;   4. multi-valued idempotency — reified claim! mints a fresh cid every call,
;;      so without this two identical link!s make duplicate live edges; we no-op
;;      when the live (l,p,r) already exists.
;;   5. atomic v2 log — each committed tx appends its records + a :commit marker,
;;      fsync'd; a torn tx (records without :commit, always trailing under a
;;      single appender) is DROPPED on replay. Durability the bb coord lacked.
;;   6. file-import optimistic concurrency — every write goes through the one
;;      lock; the base_version contract (C5) decides who wins.
