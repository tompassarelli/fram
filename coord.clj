;; Sole writer, serialized (one lock). The flat coord.clj's proven skeleton
;; (locking write-lock, optimistic base_version, rule-check, append+notify),
;; rebuilt over the reified store (fram.store + fram.schema). Full Clojure
;; — direct, mutable access to the store map, no Beagle typing friction.
;;
;; The six concurrency/durability holes the analysis flagged, closed here:
;;   1. base_version  = max tx-seq over the LIVE claims on (l,p); a stale
;;      single-valued write is rejected (lost-update protection).
;;   2. validate-without-mutating — obligations (acyclicity) are a PURE pre-check
;;      over resolved ids, run BEFORE any tx/entity is minted, so a rejected
;;      write leaves ZERO unlogged state (else the live store would diverge from
;;      a replay of the log).
;;   3. single-subject obligations (depends_on/part_of acyclicity) for v1.
;;   4. multi-valued idempotency — reified fact! mints a fresh cid every call,
;;      so without this two identical link!s make duplicate live edges; we no-op
;;      when the live (l,p,r) already exists.
;;   5. atomic v2 log — each committed tx appends its records + a :commit marker,
;;      fsync'd; a torn tx (records without :commit, always trailing under a
;;      single appender) is DROPPED on replay. Durability the bb coord lacked.
;;   6. file-import optimistic concurrency — every write goes through the one
;;      lock; the base_version contract (C5) decides who wins.

;; The convoy this kills: every commit used to hold the coordinator lock (and, in
;; the daemon, the global dlock) across its OWN open+write+fsync, so K concurrent
;; writers serialized on the disk flush — measured BEFORE: p50 grew ~7x from K=1
;; to K=16 and throughput plateaued ~700-800 writes/s. Now a commit ENQUEUES its
;; log lines (still inside the lock, so queue order == commit order == log order)
;; and durability is awaited via a TICKET (promise):
;;   * *durable-tickets* UNBOUND (library callers, tests, scripts): the enqueue
;;     awaits its ticket inline — byte-identical semantics to the old direct
;;     write+fsync (durable before the fn returns), just via the appender thread.
;;   * *durable-tickets* BOUND (the daemon binds it per request): the ticket is
;;     collected and awaited AFTER the lock is released — so the lock is held
;;     only for in-memory work, and concurrent writers' appends coalesce.
;; ONE appender thread drains the queue, appends every pending item's lines in
;; enqueue order, fsyncs ONCE per file per batch, then delivers every ticket.
;; Durability contract UNCHANGED: an ack (ticket delivery / fn return) happens
;; only after the claim's bytes are fsynced; an append/fsync failure is delivered
;; as the Throwable and rethrown on the awaiting thread (fail closed). A crash
;; before the fsync loses only UN-acked commits, exactly as before; v2 torn-tx
;; replay and the flat fold's keyed-latest already tolerate a torn tail.
