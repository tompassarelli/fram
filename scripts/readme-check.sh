# readme-check.sh — the README anti-rot gate. Run by CI; run locally with --local.
#
# A README rots silently: a renamed verb, a moved test, a stale org in a clone URL,
# a measured number no one re-ran. This gate fails CI on the mechanical ones, so the
# README stays true to the engine instead of drifting from it.
#
#   (1) stale repo URLs   — the confirmed-wrong org/repo forms must not appear.
#   (2) engine verbs      — every `bin/fram <verb>` named in README must be a real verb.
#   (3) bin entrypoints   — every `bin/fram-*` named in README must exist + be executable.
#   (4) referenced paths  — every relative link/path in README must exist.
#   (5) the core loop runs — import / validate / call / query / export on a SCRATCH copy
#                            of threads/ (the canonical facts.log is never touched).
#   --local additionally checks the toolchain (bb / clojure / java) is on PATH.
